# Vector-Field-Grapher
Duration: December 2019

After just completing my 3D calculus class in my first semester of college, the concept of vector fields still interested me. Instead of simply googling existing vector field graphers, I thought to myself, it would be a nice idea to make one of my own and to make it personal to me.

By the middle of winter break in 2019, I finished this quick project. It works just like any vector field graphers on line with a movable graph and with most functions including sin(x), e^x and log(x). I also included a divergence and curl calculator and colored vectors indicating length. It is very basic in its function but was a fun project nonetheless.
